## **Two pointers**

**Example 1**: Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, false otherwise.

A string is a palindrome if it reads the same forward as backward. That means, after reversing it, it is still the same string. For example: "abcdcba", or "racecar".

**Example 2**: Given a sorted array of unique integers and a target integer, return true if there exists a pair of numbers that sum to target, false otherwise. This problem is similar to Two Sum. (In Two Sum, the input is not sorted).

For example, given nums = [1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, 14, 15] and target = 13, return true because 4 + 9 = 13.

## **Sliding windows**

**Example 1**: Given an array of positive integers nums and an integer k, find the length of the longest subarray whose sum is less than or equal to k. This is the problem we have been talking about above. We will now formally solve it.

**Example 2**: You are given a binary string s (a string containing only "0" and "1"). You may choose up to one "0" and flip it to a "1". What is the length of the longest substring achievable that contains only "1"?

For example, given s = "1101100111", the answer is 5. If you perform the flip at index 2, the string becomes 1111100111.


## **Home task**

**Example 1**: Given two sorted integer arrays arr1 and arr2, return a new array that combines both of them and is also sorted.

**Example 2: 713. Subarray Product Less Than K.**

Given an array of positive integers nums and an integer k, return the number of subarrays where the product of all the elements in the subarray is strictly less than k.

For example, given the input nums = [10, 5, 2, 6], k = 100, the answer is 8. The subarrays with products less than k are:

[10], [5], [2], [6], [10, 5], [5, 2], [2, 6], [5, 2, 6]
